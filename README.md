Overall Project:

I constructed a home security system using an Arduino Uno R3 that sounds an alarm when appropriate motion is detected. 

Components:

1. Breadboard
2. LED's
3. IR Remote and Receiver
4. Active Buzzer
5. Ultrasonic Sensor


Description:

Upon ultrasonic sensor activation at desired distance, active buzzer is sounded. Appropriate LED's are turned on. IR remote is used to turn off the buzzer after activation by being 
pointed at IR receiver. LED's are reverted back to neutral state. All entirely programmed in C++ using appropriate libarires, helper files, and packages.
